# Car Price Prediction using Lasso Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts car prices using Linear Regression with Lasso regularization.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of Lasso Regression for car price prediction
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Visualization of results

## Repository Structure
- `car_price_prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open `car_price_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the Lasso Regression model, and evaluate the results.

## Dataset
This project uses a dataset containing car features such as make, model, year, mileage, and price.
